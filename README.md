# Cryptarithm Solver

This is a console-based Cryptarithm Solver that allows users to solve cryptarithm puzzles with different operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The solver can handle high amounts of digits and supports more than two words (e.g., "two + three + three = eleven").

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles high amounts of digits.
- Supports more than two words in the cryptarithm.
- Shows steps if possible.
- Provides a simple console-based user interface.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `main.py` script using Python.

```bash
python main.py
```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions:
- Choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- Enter the words (space-separated).
- Enter the result word.

4. The solver will display the solution if found.
